# My first Portfolio Website

Developing this website is a personal project of mine that I startetd in order to learn coding for myself. As such, it is a work in progress that is still undergoing changes. My current
challenge is improving the responsive design, eg. hamburger menu, and overall user experience. In the future I would like to add separate pages to also showcase previous projects.
